Problem Statement:
Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new
outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.
You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand to next.

The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for this problem.The first column is the "Population of a city" and the second column is the "Profit of a food truck" in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.
